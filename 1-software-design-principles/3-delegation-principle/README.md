# Delegation Principle

- Delegation is the concept of one class "delegating" its behavior to another class. Delegation can be viewed as a relationship between objects where one object forwards certain methods calls to another object.

- Delegation is a extreme example of object composition.

- Assume your class called `B` and the delegated class called `A`, use delegation if you want to enhance `A`, but `A` is `final`.
