# Single Responsibility Principle

- Single responsibility principle is all about cohesion (unit has single responsibility).

- states that every class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, the responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class.

- the responsibility is a reason to change.

- the single responsibility principle is related to coupling and cohesion concepts.
  - **coupling** is the degree of interdependence between software classes or methods.
  - **cohesion** refers to what the class (or method) can do.

- low coupling -> small dependencies between classes/methods, easier to change code without introducing bugs.
- tight coupling -> means two classes/methods are closely connected. A change in one affects the other.
- low cohesion -> means that the class does a great variety of actions.
- high cohesion -> means that the class is focused on what it should be doing.

- the single responsibility principle is about designing a loosely coupled and high cohesive classes.
