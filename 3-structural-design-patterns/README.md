# Structural Patterns

- describes how classes and objects can be combined to form larger structures.
  - utilizes the inheritance to compose interfaces or implementations
  - structural object pattern describe ways to assemble objects
  
- these design pattern concern class and object composition.


## Class Patterns vs Object Patterns

1. class patterns describe how relationships between classes are defined.
  - **use inheritance** to compose interfaces or implementations.
  - relationships are established at **compile-time**.

2. object patterns describe relationships between objects.
   - describe ways to compose objects.
   - **use composition**
   - relationships are typically created **at runtime** (more dynamic and flexible)
