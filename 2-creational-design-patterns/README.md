# Creational Design Patterns

- A program should not depend on how objects are created and arranged.
- Tying your code to a concrete class can make it more fragile and less flexible.
- Creational design patterns provide a way to create objects.
- Creational design patterns abstract the instantiation process, The creation logic is hidden.
- Programmer may call a method or use another object, rather than instantiating objects directly using the `new` operator.

## Class patterns VS Object Patterns
- Class Patterns: describe the relationships between class are defined.
  - use inheritance
  - relationships are established at compile-time

- Object patterns: describe the relationships between objects
  - use composition
  - relationships are typically created at runtime.
  - more flexible and dynamic
