# Design Patterns

1. The design patterns are divided into three groups:
   1. **Creational** --> concerns the process of object creation.
   2. **Structural** --> deal with the composition of classes or objects
   3. **Behavioral** --> characterize the ways in which the classes and objects interact and distribute responsibility.

2. Design patterns can be classified by scope (applies to objects or to classes) into:
   1. Class pattern
   2. Object pattern

## Creational Pattern
- A program should not depend on how objects are created and arranged.
- Creational patterns abstract (hiding details) the instantiation process:
    - creation logic is hidden through encapsulation.
    - developer can a method or use an object rather than using `new`.


## Structural Pattern
- describe how classes and objects can be combined to form larger structures using inheritance and composition.
- describe ways to assemble objects.

## Behavioral Pattern
- these patterns are concerned with communication between objects.
- concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects..
